- 👋 Hi, I’m @TeachologyChalk
- 👀 I’m interested in Test Driven Development (TDD) and adminstering exams via Google Forms, Google Sheets and their APIs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning about how to better use AI to enhance my research and enable me to write production ready code.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects about adminstering exams and automating the grading and feedback based on a dynamic rubric.
- 📫 How to reach me @TeachologyChalk
- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know that the iconic green or black surface of traditional chalkboards is actually made of slate? Slate is a fine-grained metamorphic rock that has been used for centuries as a writing surface.
